As a result, the actual presence of an interaction may be the result of local environmental or ecological contexts. The occurrence of an interaction may be due to the presence or absence of alternative partners (e.g., species may only interact with low-quality partners only if high-quality partners are absent), or directly due to abiotic conditions (e.g., one species’ preferences for or phenological overlap with a potential partner may change as a function of temperature). Given the tight coupling between their interactions, we expect that phylogenetically specialized symbionts to have little deviation between the potential and realized geography of their interactions, while we expect phylogenetically generalist species to realize a proportionally smaller portion of their potential geography. To test this hypothesis, we use a distribution modeling framework to predict the geographic overlap of symbiotic species, and then compare that overlap to models explicitly trained on geographic records of their interactions. We apply this framework to large-scale floral visitation, frugivory, and host-parasite networks. We find that congruence between geographic overlap and realized interactions differs across network types, but is generally higher for more phylogenetically specialized symbionts. Our results highlight the role that local ecological and environmental contexts play in mediating facultative interspecific interactions, and ultimately the potential for changing environments to alter ecological network structures.\n","date":1707004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1707004800,"objectID":"bfb73631dd0586bbe3cf79e90cbd7c5e","permalink":"https://example.com/project/intermod/","publishdate":"2024-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/intermod/","section":"project","summary":"Across their geographic ranges, potential symbionts may interact any place they co-occur, or they may interact in only a subset of these sites.

These local-scale changes have important impacts on regional-scale metacommunity structure and stability, and understanding the role biotic interactions play in mediating these processes can yield important insights into the maintenance of interaction network structure across scales. In order to help bridge this gap, we incorporate competitor-mediated dispersal (CMD) processes into a model of plant-pollinator network assembly across a spatially-explicit metacommunity. In addition to more broadly providing insight into feedbacks between biotic interactions and metacommunity dynamics within the context of mutualistic networks, we aim to answer the following research questions: 1) At the metacommunity scale, does the presence or strength of CMD processes tend to stabilize or destabilize population and community dynamics? 2) Do CMD processes allow the persistence of generalist species where they may be otherwise excluded? And 3) Do CMD processes, in concert with environmental heterogeneity, work to dampen or amplify spatial “hotspots” or “coldspots” of generalism?\n","date":1674518400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674518400,"objectID":"02a644384059876f8c258978d57f1fd0","permalink":"https://example.com/project/metacon/","publishdate":"2023-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/metacon/","section":"project","summary":"In nature, local species interaction networks are dynamic, changing in composition and structural properties as new species disperse to the area, existing species become locally extirpated, and as existing links rewire to form new associations or dissolve old ones.","tags":["Networks","Theory"],"title":"Mutualistic Network Assembly Across Space","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The observed structure of a consumer-resource network consists of only a subset of potential links within that network.

These predictions can guide targeted sampling of predicted links between rare species as well as give insight into potential interactions that may occur as species’ ranges shift. These interactions may be predicted using a variety of information types; understanding how different kinds of information compare in their ability to predict links between different types of nodes is important.

There is clear overlap in putative causes for epidemic similarity, such as geographic distance, age structure, and population size. We compare the effects of these potential drivers on epidemic similarity compared to a baseline assumption that differences in the basic reproductive number (R0) will translate to differences in epidemic trajectories.\\\nMethods: Using COVID-19 case counts from United States counties, we explore the importance of geographic distance, population size differences, and age structure dissimilarity on resulting epidemic similarity.\\\nResults: We find clear effects of geographic space, age structure, population size, and R0 on epidemic similarity, but notably the effect of age structure was stronger than the baseline assumption that differences in R0 would be most related to epidemic similarity. \\\nConclusions: Together, this highlights the role of spatial and demographic processes on SARS-CoV2 epidemics in the United States.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Epidemic time series similarity is related to geographic distance and age structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The large spatial scale, geographical overlap, and similarities in transmission mode between the 1918 H1N1 influenza and 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemics together provide a novel opportunity to investigate relationships between transmission of two different diseases in the same location. To this end, we use initial exponential growth rates in a Bayesian hierarchical framework to estimate the basic reproductive number, R0, of both disease outbreaks in a common set of 43 cities in the United States. By leveraging multiple epidemic time series across a large spatial area, we are able to better characterize the variation in R0 across the United States. Additionally, we provide one of the first city-level comparisons of R0 between these two pandemics and explore how demography and outbreak timing are related to R0. Despite similarities in transmission modes and a common set of locations, R0 estimates for COVID-19 were uncorrelated with estimates of pandemic influenza R0 in the same cities. Also, the relationships between R0 and key population or epidemic traits differed between diseases. For example, epidemics that started later tended to be less severe for COVID-19, while influenza epidemics exhibited an opposite pattern. Our results suggest that despite similarities between diseases, epidemics starting in the same location may differ markedly in their initial progression.\nThis work has been published in PNAS: Nexus with open access available to the public, read it here!\n","date":1663977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663977600,"objectID":"d89889e880dda3760c1c33b785d224c3","permalink":"https://example.com/project/revisit1918/","publishdate":"2022-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/revisit1918/","section":"project","summary":"The large spatial scale, geographical overlap, and similarities in transmission mode between the 1918 H1N1 influenza and 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemics together provide a novel opportunity to investigate relationships between transmission of two different diseases in the same location.","tags":["Theory","Disease"],"title":"Comparisons of Covid-19 Outbreak Dynamics across space and time","type":"project"},{"authors":["Grant Foster","Bret Elderd","Robbie L Richards","Tad Dallas"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
