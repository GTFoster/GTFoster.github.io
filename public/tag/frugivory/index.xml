      <title>Understanding Ecological Interactions Across Geographic Ranges</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Across their geographic ranges, potential symbionts may interact any place they co-occur, or they may interact in only a subset of these sites. As a result, the actual presence of an interaction may be the result of local environmental or ecological contexts. The occurrence of an interaction may be due to the presence or absence of alternative partners (e.g., species may only interact with low-quality partners only if high-quality partners are absent), or directly due to abiotic conditions (e.g., one species’ preferences for or phenological overlap with a potential partner may change as a function of temperature). Given the tight coupling between their interactions, we expect that phylogenetically specialized symbionts to have little deviation between the potential and realized geography of their interactions, while we expect phylogenetically generalist species to realize a proportionally smaller portion of their potential geography. To test this hypothesis, we use a distribution modeling framework to predict the geographic overlap of symbiotic species, and then compare that overlap to models explicitly trained on geographic records of their interactions. We apply this framework to large-scale floral visitation, frugivory, and host-parasite networks. We find that congruence between geographic overlap and realized interactions differs across network types, but is generally higher for more phylogenetically specialized symbionts. Our results highlight the role that local ecological and environmental contexts play in mediating facultative interspecific interactions, and ultimately the potential for changing environments to alter ecological network structures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Link Prediction in Tropical Plant-Frugivore Interaction Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The observed structure of a consumer-resource network consists of only a subset of potential links within that network. The true structure deviates from the metaweb of potential interactions due to stochastic assembly processes, while sampling effort limitations and error mean our observed network likely imperfectly represents this realized structure. Link prediction methods allow us to construct potential metawebs for a given empirical network. These predictions can guide targeted sampling of predicted links between rare species as well as give insight into potential interactions that may occur as species’ ranges shift. These interactions may be predicted using a variety of information types; understanding how different kinds of information compare in their ability to predict links between different types of nodes is important. To this end, we compare random-forest classifier models informed by combinations of phylogenetic structure, species traits, and latent network structure in their ability to predict interactions in a diverse network of fruiting plants and frugivorous birds in Brazil’s Atlantic forest.&lt;/p&gt;
