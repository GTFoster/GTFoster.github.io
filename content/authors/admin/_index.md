I’m Grant Foster a quantitative ecologist in training at the University of South Carolina under [Dr. Tad Dallas](https://taddallas.github.io/). I’m interested in undergraduate ecology education, and hope to be able to pursue a tenure-track teaching position following graduation from my PhD. I’m also interested in other things, including integrating computational data science with Ecology and modeling species interaction networks. Outside of research, I enjoy spending time outside with my dog, gardening, and recording wildlife using [ebird](https://ebird.org/profile/OTUzMjYw/US-SC-079) and [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/5346167)-feel free to connect with me there if you're interested!
