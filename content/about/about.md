I'm [Grant Foster](https://github.com/GTFoster) a quantitative ecologist in training at the University of South Carolina under Dr. Tad Dallas. I'm interested in undergraduate ecology education, and hope to be able to pursue a tenure-track teaching position following graduation from my PhD. I'm also interested in other things, including integrating computational data science with Ecology and modeling species interaction networks. 

**Interests:** Undergraduate Biology/Ecology Education · Ecological Networks · Theoretical Ecology · Community Assembly Dynamics · Disease Ecology ·
