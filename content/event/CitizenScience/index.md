title: Citizen Science in a Changing World (Speaker + Panelist)

event: Society for Philosophy of Science in Practice Conference
event_url: https://philosophy-science-practice.org/events/spsp2024-columbia/citizen-science-in-south-carolina-and-beyond-pre-conference-workshop

location: University of South Carolina

summary: Large-scale participatory science projects such as iNaturalist and eBird present outstanding opportunities to collect data useful for answering biological questions, as well as get people engaged in their local environments. This talk walks through some of the potential pros and cons of these types of "use-agnostic" programs across multiple perspectives. By better understanding how these data are generated, what the quality control and assurance processes are, and how individual citizens can get involved, we can better understand how to use these powerful tools.
