As biologists we code frequently in our work, but many of us didn't learn to code in the classroom. As such, when we're then trying to assess coding skills in our own classrooms, we may not always be aware of the variety of different assessment styles at our disposal. As part of a collaborative project with members of the [Biological and Environmental Data Education (BEDE) Network](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/bede), we're looking to create a guide to potential assessment tailored to biological sciences. We hope to turn this work into a public facing resource available to biology instructors everywhere!
