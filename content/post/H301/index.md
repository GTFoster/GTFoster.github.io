In Fall 2023, I was able to be the teaching assistant for the honors section of Ecology and Evolution lab under [Dr. Trey Franklin](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/biological_sciences/our_people/directory/franklin_william.php). A number of the labs associated with this course include analytical components that have historically been taught in R. However, for the honors section this year I instead included a (hopefully) gentle introduction to R, which students used throughout the semester. 

A zip file containing all the student-facing I created R materials and necessary associated data can be downloaded [here](/uploads/BIOL301L_Materials.zip). Feel free to adapt or use any of these materials in your own classes, or reach out if you have any ideas of questions!
