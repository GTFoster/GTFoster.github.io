 # Link Prediction in Tropical Plant-Frugivore Interaction Networks

The observed structure of a consumer-resource network consists of only a subset of potential links within that network. The true structure deviates from the metaweb of potential interactions due to stochastic assembly processes, while sampling effort limitations and error mean our observed network likely imperfectly represents this realized structure. Link prediction methods allow us to construct potential metawebs for a given empirical network. These predictions can guide targeted sampling of predicted links between rare species as well as give insight into potential interactions that may occur as species' ranges shift. These interactions may be predicted using a variety of information types; understanding how different kinds of information compare in their ability to predict links between different types of nodes is important. To this end, we compare random-forest classifier models informed by combinations of phylogenetic structure, species traits, and latent network structure in their ability to predict interactions in a diverse network of fruiting plants and frugivorous birds in Brazil's Atlantic forest.
 
 # Mutualistic Network Assembly Across Space

 In nature, local species interaction networks are dynamic, changing in composition and structural properties as new species disperse to the area, existing species become locally extirpated, and as existing links rewire to form new associations or dissolve old ones. These local-scale changes have important impacts on regional-scale metacommunity structure and stability, and understanding the role biotic interactions play in mediating these processes can yield important insights into the maintenance of interaction network structure across scales. In order to help bridge this gap, we incorporate competitor-mediated dispersal (CMD) processes into a model of plant-pollinator network assembly across a spatially-explicit metacommunity. In addition to more broadly providing insight into feedbacks between biotic interactions and metacommunity dynamics within the context of mutualistic networks, we aim to answer the following research questions: 1) At the metacommunity scale, does the presence or strength of CMD processes tend to stabilize or destabilize population and community dynamics? 2) Do CMD processes allow the persistence of generalist species where they may be otherwise excluded? And 3) Do CMD processes, in concert with environmental heterogeneity, work to dampen or amplify spatial “hotspots” or “coldspots” of generalism?
  
 # Changes in Mutualistic Network Architecture in Response to Human Change

  Anthropogenic disturbance and climate change impacts nearly all ecosystems on the planet through a number of mechanisms, one of which may be the altering of mutualistic interactions. Species turnover due to invasion and extinction, mismatches in species phenology, and other factors may fundamentally alter the architecture of mutualistic networks in many systems. These architectural changes may have predictable impacts on network features such as network stability or strength of hysteresis. Understanding how the structure of mutualistic networks are changing in general as well how these changes effect emergent network properties can allow us to better predict and manage threatened ecosystems. 
  
 # Lessons from our neighbors and the past: Comparisons of Covid-19 Outbreak Dynamics across space and time

The large spatial scale, geographical overlap, and similarities in transmission mode between the 1918 H1N1 influenza and 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemics together provide a novel opportunity to investigate relationships between transmission of two different diseases in the same location. To this end, we use initial exponential growth rates in a Bayesian hierarchical framework to estimate the basic reproductive number, R0, of both disease outbreaks in a common set of 43 cities in the United States. By leveraging multiple epidemic time series across a large spatial area, we are able to better characterize the variation in R0 across the United States. Additionally, we provide one of the first city-level comparisons of R0 between these two pandemics and explore how demography and outbreak timing are related to R0. Despite similarities in transmission modes and a common set of locations, R0 estimates for COVID-19 were uncorrelated with estimates of pandemic influenza R0 in the same cities. Also, the relationships between R0 and key population or epidemic traits differed between diseases. For example, epidemics that started later tended to be less severe for COVID-19, while influenza epidemics exhibited an opposite pattern. Our results suggest that despite similarities between diseases, epidemics starting in the same location may differ markedly in their initial progression.
