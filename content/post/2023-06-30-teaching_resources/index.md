This is a spot where I can share resources I've used in my classrooms. I'm currently in the process of developing R modules for Ecology and Evolution lab, as well as co-developing a Disease Ecology course with Tad Dallas here at USC. I'll update this page with resources and materials as I finish those things!

In the meantime, I encourage you to check out the [Biological and Environmental Data Education (BEDE) Network page on Quebeshub](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/bede). The network has some free available modules that can be integrated into classrooms, as well as a framework for developing datascience-driven student learning objectives to implement in undergraduate life sciences. Plus, they're a great group of people to get involved with if your looking to develop educational materials or revamp existing ones!

More to come!
