summary: Student-facing materials for an upper level disease ecology lab!
---

In Spring of 2024, I was was enough to able to co-develop and co-teach Parasitology (BIOL 531/ENHS 661/EPID 661) alongside Tad Dallas. 

The course has an associated weekly 3 hour lab that I was able to create materials for, which I split between a mix of hands-on and computational labs using R. The syllabus for this course, as well as all student facing materials (both those created by myself and Tad) are publicly available on the [course website here](https://dallaslab.github.io/diseaseEcology/syllabus/)

Feel free to implement any of these activities or assignments into you own courses! I'm also happy to provide instructor-facing implementation and grading notes for each of the labs as well; just send me an email!
