## Overall background/experience: 


## Objective: 
As human beings we live in the context of our natural environment, and interact both directly and indirectly with population and ecosystem-level processes of that environment every day. One of my main objectives as an instructor is to allow students to recognize and understand those interactions. By internalizing links between conceptual ecological theory and observations in their own day-to-day lives, students gain a more holistic understanding of the world around them. Beyond being personally fulfilling, these connections increase students’ retention of biological principles and encourage them to consider and apply them in new contexts. 

As an instructor, I also feel the ecology classroom is an ideal setting for students to develop and practice critical and scientific thinking skills to solve complex issues. Ecological and environmental problems are complex by nature, and coming up with solutions that satisfy the needs of diverse stakeholders requires critical analysis and creative thinking. By looking at case studies and developing solutions in the classroom, students build and practice these skills while simultaneously applying course content in novel ways. 
	
I also think ecology is an excellent opportunity to develop quantitative reasoning skills. Data-driven thinking and analysis is a skill needed by a huge number of people across a variety of skills, and preparing students to deal with the messy data of the real world is a vital part of their education. By asking students to interpret ecological data presented across a variety of forms, students will become better equipped with these skills to make sense of quantitative patterns through noise. By emphasizing and asking students how to interpret things like uncertainty, measurement error, and bias, students in my courses can become more adept at critically evaluating and synthesizing data regardless of their career. These skills are incredibly important in the modern world and workplace, as the big-data revolution changes the way so many industries make decisions. “Messy” data is everywhere, and I want students to be able to understand how to glean relevant meaning from their own data sets. 


## Methods: 
T) My goal is to create a community of learning in my courses through implementation of backwards course design principles matching levels of student support to the courses’ challenges, cultivating an environment of openness and mutual respect. 
	
1) Backwards design

2) Stanford's Theory of Challenge and Support (1966)

3) Cultivating Inclusive Learning Community
Clear and open communication, and clear rubrics and expectations for assignments and grades

## Evaluation

1) Backwards design 
2) Project-based; sense of student ownership and agency
3) Emphasize multiple mediums of scientific communication
